# Avalyn RPC Client
With the features and commands listed above, there is still more, embedded within its coding is the Avalyn RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Client. Which in some cases allows users to communicate with Avalyn without Discord access, all securely processed client-side.

This light-weight RPC client allows ease of use, as it allows some functions to be operated outside of the Discord Framework.

Some use cases include functions that are bound to the Avalyn Blockchain and the Avalyn Web UI.


Avalyn RPC Usage Cases
-
This includes, but not limited to

- Genesis Block Creation. (/genesis)
- Avalyn Crypto Wallet Creation. (/wallet)
- Avalyn Blockchain Data. (/height, /blocks [Number Number])
- Stock or Cryptocurrency Price Checks. (/stock [Name/Ticker], /crypto [Name/Ticker])

# Upcoming Features
- - What we plan here, what we had planned, has evolved.
> The original plan was to simply create a Discord assistant that could help with moderation and organization of my own Discord server and channels.

> Then curiousity, of what I could do, what Avalyn could be.

With that in mind, if you have any questions or comments, you can contact us at contact@getavalyn.org
